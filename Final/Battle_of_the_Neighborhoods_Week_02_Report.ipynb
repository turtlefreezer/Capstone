Foursquare data will be very helpful in making data-driven decisions about the best of those areas."

I originally intended to use the clustering algorythms to cluster the data, but as it progressed it became obvious that this only complicated the task at hand. The analysis and results are not an end point, but rather a starting point that will guide the next part of the process to find specific store locations.
