        "Berlin, the capital of Germany, was a divided city for more almost three decades. From 1961 to 1989 a wall separated the western from the eastern part, caused by a power play between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies. Over the course of these years, economic and cultural life developed in two different directions. While a large number of smaller shops and venues were established in West Berlin, the focus in the East was on restoring a rich cultural life for the broad masses. Today, thirty years after the fall of the Wall, the situation has certainly changed, but developments from the past still partly shape the face of this city.\n",
        "\n",
        "One basic assumption is that the theatre landscape, in particular, is still divided into two parts and thus there is still a high development potential for this, especially in the western parts of the city. Thus, it should be examined in which districts a significant underdevelopment in this cultural area exists and where there is a chance for theatres to settle."
